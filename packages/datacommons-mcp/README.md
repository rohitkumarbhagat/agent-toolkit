# Data Commons MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for fetching public statistical data from [Data Commons](https://datacommons.org) instances.

Data Commons is an open knowledge repository that provides a unified view across multiple public data sets and statistics.  This server allows any MCP-enabled agent or client to query the Data Commons knowledge graph.

## Features
* **MCP-Compliant:** Implements the Model Context Protocol for seamless agent integration.
* **Data Commons Access:** Fetches public statistics and data from the base datacommons.org knowledge graph.
* **Custom Instance Support:** Can be configured to work with Custom Data Commons instances.
* **Flexible Serving:** Runs over both streamable HTTP and stdio.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

1.  You must have a Data Commons API key; create one at [apikeys.datacommons.org](https://apikeys.datacommons.org/).
2.  Install `uv` by following the [official installation instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation).

### Configuration

Set the following required environment variable in your shell:

```
export DC_API_KEY=<your API key>
```

### Start the server 

Run the server from your command line in one of two modes:

**Streamable HTTP**

This runs the server with Streamable HTTP.

```bash
# Runs on default port 8080
uvx datacommons-mcp serve http [--port <PORT>]
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:<port>/mcp`.

**stdio**

This transport mode is intended for local integrations and is programmatically configured within a client (like Gemini CLI settings) to communicate over `stdio`.

```bash
uvx datacommons-mcp serve stdio
```

### Optional documentation resource

`DC_ENABLE_DOCUMENTATION_RESOURCE` sets the server default (false when unset).
For stdio, pass this environment variable when launching the server process.

HTTP clients can override the default in their MCP connection configuration:

```json
"headers": {
  "X-DC-Enable-Documentation": "true"
}
```

Use `"false"` to opt out even when the server default is enabled. Omit the header
to inherit the server default. Values are case-insensitive and surrounding
whitespace is ignored; other values produce an invalid-parameters error.
Send the same preference on every request and reconnect after changing it.

When enabled, a documentation routing hint follows the existing server
instructions and the documentation index appears in resource listings. The
server fetches `llms.txt` only when the resource is read. When disabled, the
index is omitted from listings and direct reads are rejected. Existing tools
and skills are unaffected.

## Clients

You can use any MCP-enabled agent or client to connect to your running server. For example, see the [Data Commons MCP documentation](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/agent-toolkit/blob/main/docs/user_guide.md) for guides on connecting:
* [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/agent-toolkit/blob/main/docs/quickstart.md)
* [Google ADK natively](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/agent-toolkit/blob/main/docs/user_guide.md#use-the-sample-agent)
* [Google ADK in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/datacommonsorg/agent-toolkit/blob/main/notebooks/datacommons_mcp_tools_with_custom_agent.ipynb)

Or see your preferred client's documentation for how to configure it, using the commands listed above.

## Advanced Configuration
### Using MCP Tools with a Custom Data Commons

Follow the [Guide for using MCP Tools with Custom Data Commons](https://github.com/datacommonsorg/agent-toolkit/blob/main/docs/user_guide.md#custom-data-commons) to set additional environment variables required for custom configuration.
